# COVID_APP

This is an app I designed on the ionic platform using typescript for the HCL BetterHealth hackathon. The app takes pre-existing conditions, demographic data, location, and precautionary steps, and finally, an activity and displays a time versus probability of showing symptoms that are directly related to having COVID-19. The app has two main buttons: a preview button and a submit button. The preview button shows the probability before and after having undertaken the task, in order to provide the user an idea of how much exposure to the virus he or she may face, potentialy influencing a decision. The submit would usually be pressed after the activity, and this adds the COVID probability to the overall line. The probabilities of catching COVID are derived from the CDC website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html), and these are used in the app. If you are a young Asian women, you're probability of getting COVID is much less likely than an elderly black male. The data from the app is stored locally on the cellphonr, and retrieved at startup on the next use, so it doesn't forget the previous session when adding new curves to the graph.
